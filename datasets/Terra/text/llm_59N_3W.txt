You are a meteorological expert responsible for explaining the factors that influence climate in specific regions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

We have a series environment-related data for a global grid divided into 1x1 degree latitude and longitude cells. Please generate a detailed text for given grid cell describing the main factors that may influence climate in that area. Include the following aspects:
                1. **Geographical Location**: Which continent or country does it belong to?
                2. **Climate Type**: What type of climate does this area have (e.g., tropical, temperate, polar)?
                3. **Ocean Influence**: Is this area close to the ocean or large water bodies? How does the ocean influence the rainfall?
                4. **Terrain**: What are the terrain features of this area (e.g., mountains, plains, deserts)?
                5. **Monsoons**: Is this area affected by monsoons? How do monsoons influence the rainfall?
                6. **Airflows and Wind Belts**: What are the main airflows and wind belts affecting this area?
                7. **Vegetation Cover**: What is the vegetation cover like in this area? How does vegetation influence rainfall?
                8. **Human Activities**: How do human activities (e.g., agriculture, urbanization) influence rainfall in this area?
                I will provide the latitude and longitude range of the area I want to describe, along with the vegetation type percentage, climate type and average altitude of the area. This information can be used as a reference to generate a more accurate description, but do not just focus on these points. 
                If there is no climate type, it means this area is primarily ocean.
                Please write the description in a paragraph, and avoid saying other things.
                Please generate a text description for (58,59)N and (2,3)W in country None according to the above structure.
                If the country information is None, this region does not belong to any country.

Generated:The grid cell located at (58,59)N and (2,3)W in the country None is situated in the northernmost part of the Atlantic Ocean, near the western coast of Europe. This region falls under the temperate marine climate category, characterized by mild winters and cool summers. The proximity to the ocean plays a significant role in shaping the local climate, with the warm Gulf Stream influencing the region's temperature and rainfall patterns. The prevailing westerly winds bring moisture-laden air from the Atlantic, resulting in moderate rainfall throughout the year. The terrain of this area is relatively flat, with an average elevation of approximately -62.333 meters below sea level, indicating that it is a coastal lowland. The region is not affected by monsoons, as it is not located near any tropical regions. The main airflows and wind belts influencing this area are the westerly winds and the trade winds. The vegetation cover is predominantly composed of water bodies (89.444%), with a smaller percentage of grasslands (9.167%) and a mix of cropland and tree cover. Human activities such as agriculture and urbanization have a limited impact on the local climate, as the region is primarily used for fishing and coastal activities. Overall, the unique combination of oceanic influence, flat terrain, and vegetation cover shapes the climate of this region, resulting in a mild and humid environment.
