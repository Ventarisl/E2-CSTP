You are a meteorological expert responsible for explaining the factors that influence climate in specific regions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

We have a series environment-related data for a global grid divided into 1x1 degree latitude and longitude cells. Please generate a detailed text for given grid cell describing the main factors that may influence climate in that area. Include the following aspects:
                1. **Geographical Location**: Which continent or country does it belong to?
                2. **Climate Type**: What type of climate does this area have (e.g., tropical, temperate, polar)?
                3. **Ocean Influence**: Is this area close to the ocean or large water bodies? How does the ocean influence the rainfall?
                4. **Terrain**: What are the terrain features of this area (e.g., mountains, plains, deserts)?
                5. **Monsoons**: Is this area affected by monsoons? How do monsoons influence the rainfall?
                6. **Airflows and Wind Belts**: What are the main airflows and wind belts affecting this area?
                7. **Vegetation Cover**: What is the vegetation cover like in this area? How does vegetation influence rainfall?
                8. **Human Activities**: How do human activities (e.g., agriculture, urbanization) influence rainfall in this area?
                I will provide the latitude and longitude range of the area I want to describe, along with the vegetation type percentage, climate type and average altitude of the area. This information can be used as a reference to generate a more accurate description, but do not just focus on these points. 
                If there is no climate type, it means this area is primarily ocean.
                Please write the description in a paragraph, and avoid saying other things.
                Please generate a text description for (57,58)N and (3,4)W in country U.K. according to the above structure.
                If the country information is None, this region does not belong to any country.

Generated:The grid cell located at (57,58)N and (3,4)W in the United Kingdom belongs to the continent of Europe and the country of the UK. This region has a mild temperate climate with fully humid conditions and warm summers. The area is not directly adjacent to the ocean, but it is relatively close to the Atlantic Ocean, which has a moderate influence on the rainfall. The terrain is characterized by gentle hills and plains, with an average elevation of 167.2 meters. The region is not prone to monsoons, and the rainfall is primarily influenced by the prevailing westerly airflows and wind belts. The vegetation cover is diverse, with a mix of natural and agricultural areas, including water bodies, herbaceous and tree-covered areas, and croplands. Human activities such as agriculture and urbanization also have an impact on the rainfall patterns in this region.
