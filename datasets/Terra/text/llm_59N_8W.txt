You are a meteorological expert responsible for explaining the factors that influence climate in specific regions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

We have a series environment-related data for a global grid divided into 1x1 degree latitude and longitude cells. Please generate a detailed text for given grid cell describing the main factors that may influence climate in that area. Include the following aspects:
                1. **Geographical Location**: Which continent or country does it belong to?
                2. **Climate Type**: What type of climate does this area have (e.g., tropical, temperate, polar)?
                3. **Ocean Influence**: Is this area close to the ocean or large water bodies? How does the ocean influence the rainfall?
                4. **Terrain**: What are the terrain features of this area (e.g., mountains, plains, deserts)?
                5. **Monsoons**: Is this area affected by monsoons? How do monsoons influence the rainfall?
                6. **Airflows and Wind Belts**: What are the main airflows and wind belts affecting this area?
                7. **Vegetation Cover**: What is the vegetation cover like in this area? How does vegetation influence rainfall?
                8. **Human Activities**: How do human activities (e.g., agriculture, urbanization) influence rainfall in this area?
                I will provide the latitude and longitude range of the area I want to describe, along with the vegetation type percentage, climate type and average altitude of the area. This information can be used as a reference to generate a more accurate description, but do not just focus on these points. 
                If there is no climate type, it means this area is primarily ocean.
                Please write the description in a paragraph, and avoid saying other things.
                Please generate a text description for (58,59)N and (7,8)W in country None according to the above structure.
                If the country information is None, this region does not belong to any country.

Generated:The grid cell located at (58,59)N and (7,8)W belongs to the North Atlantic Ocean, specifically the area known as the North Atlantic Gyre. This region is characterized by a temperate oceanic climate, with mild winters and cool summers. The ocean plays a significant role in shaping the climate of this area, with the warmth of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Current influencing the temperature and precipitation patterns. The proximity to the ocean also leads to a significant impact on the rainfall, with most of the precipitation coming from the prevailing westerly winds that bring moisture-laden air from the Atlantic. The terrain is characterized by a gentle slope, with an average altitude of -95.933 meters, which is below sea level due to the region's location in the North Atlantic Ocean. There are no mountains or hills in this area, and the landscape is relatively flat. Monsoons do not affect this region, as it is outside the monsoon belts. The main airflows affecting this area are the westerly winds, which bring moisture and precipitation from the Atlantic. The vegetation cover is primarily composed of water (88.611%), with some sparse vegetation and bare areas, which do not significantly influence the rainfall. Human activities, such as fishing and shipping, have a minimal impact on the rainfall in this area. Overall, the climate of this region is influenced by its location in the North Atlantic Ocean, with the warmth of the Gulf Stream and the prevailing westerly winds playing a significant role in shaping the temperature and precipitation patterns.
