You are a meteorological expert responsible for explaining the factors that influence climate in specific regions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

We have a series environment-related data for a global grid divided into 1x1 degree latitude and longitude cells. Please generate a detailed text for given grid cell describing the main factors that may influence climate in that area. Include the following aspects:
                1. **Geographical Location**: Which continent or country does it belong to?
                2. **Climate Type**: What type of climate does this area have (e.g., tropical, temperate, polar)?
                3. **Ocean Influence**: Is this area close to the ocean or large water bodies? How does the ocean influence the rainfall?
                4. **Terrain**: What are the terrain features of this area (e.g., mountains, plains, deserts)?
                5. **Monsoons**: Is this area affected by monsoons? How do monsoons influence the rainfall?
                6. **Airflows and Wind Belts**: What are the main airflows and wind belts affecting this area?
                7. **Vegetation Cover**: What is the vegetation cover like in this area? How does vegetation influence rainfall?
                8. **Human Activities**: How do human activities (e.g., agriculture, urbanization) influence rainfall in this area?
                I will provide the latitude and longitude range of the area I want to describe, along with the vegetation type percentage, climate type and average altitude of the area. This information can be used as a reference to generate a more accurate description, but do not just focus on these points. 
                If there is no climate type, it means this area is primarily ocean.
                Please write the description in a paragraph, and avoid saying other things.
                Please generate a text description for (57,58)N and (2,3)W in country U.K. according to the above structure.
                If the country information is None, this region does not belong to any country.

Generated:The grid cell located at (57,58)N and (2,3)W falls within the United Kingdom, specifically in the western part of Scotland. This region has a mild temperate climate with fully humid conditions and a warm summer. The area is relatively close to the Atlantic Ocean, which plays a significant role in shaping its climate. The prevailing westerly winds bring moisture-laden air from the ocean, leading to significant rainfall throughout the year. The terrain is characterized by rolling hills and low-lying valleys, with an average elevation of approximately 113.1 meters. The landscape is predominantly covered with grasslands, croplands, and urban areas, with a mix of natural and agricultural vegetation. The land use pattern is diverse, with 40.56% of the area covered in water, 31.11% in cropland, and 11.94% in grasslands. The urban area covers around 7.5%, while the remaining 8.6% is a mosaic of different vegetation types. The mild climate and proximity to the ocean result in a relatively high level of rainfall, with the prevailing westerly winds and the warmth of the Gulf Stream contributing to the region's mild and wet climate.
